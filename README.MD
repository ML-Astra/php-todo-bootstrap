# PHP TODO

## Why does this exsist
I got bored one morning whilst being a massive insomniac. It took me about 2 and half hours to make, and I learnt a lot in the process.

## How to set up?
Download and unzip. Put it on your webserver/devserver and change the values inside the conf/sql-connect.php file.

```
$dsn='mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=todoapp';
$sqlun='root';
$sqlpw='';
```
